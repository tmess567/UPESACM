                                        It’s hard to think of a world without blogs. Some blogs
                                        educate, help people collaborate, spark ideas and expand our
                                        thought universe. Others stir emotions and anger us or make
                                        us laugh. Here are a few informative blogs written by Team

                                                    <p>During the past few years, cloud computing
                                                        has become a key IT buzzword. Although the
                                                        definition of cloud computing is still
                                                        "cloudy", the trade press and bloggers label
                                                        many vendors as cloud computing vendors, and
                                                        report on their services and issues. Cloud
                                                        computing is in its infancy in terms of
                                                        market adoption. However, it is a key IT
                                                        megatrend that will take root. The article
                                                        would give you a glimpse of advantages of
                                                        cloud computing which would implies why the
                                                        cloud computing have expanding their roots.
                                                        Here are some the advantages that I have
                                                        explored. Firstly very common The users can
                                                        increase or decrease the level of use of the
                                                        computing resources and services flexibly
                                                        and easily. Secondly The 3rd party provider
                                                        owns and manages all the computing resources
                                                        (servers, software, storage, and networking)
                                                        and electricity needed for the services. The
                                                        users only need to "plug into" the cloud.
                                                        The users do not need to make a large
                                                        upfront investment on computing resources;
                                                        the space needed to house them; electricity
                                                        needed to run the computing resources; and
                                                        the cost of maintaining staff for
                                                        administering the system, network, and
                                                        database. Moreover The users pay most likely
                                                        much less for the services, because they pay
                                                        only for the computing resources and
                                                        services they use, and the
                                                        subscription-based or pay-per-use charges
                                                        are likely much lower than the cost of
                                                        maintaining on-premises computing resources.
                                                        If the users are to maintain on-premises
                                                        computing resources, they also need to make
                                                        the worst-case plan to account for the
                                                        occasional or seasonal peak needs. And also
                                                        it provide the facility to acess the cloud
                                                        anytime from anywhere.</p>

                                                    <p>In 1961, John McCathy, for the first time
                                                        publicly suggested that the computing power
                                                        and the information technology can be
                                                        delivered as a utility to business, much
                                                        like the electricity and later in 2000s, it
                                                        became a reality when cloud computing came
                                                        into the business. Cloud computing is not a
                                                        new technology but an old one which in very
                                                        simple words is a way for delivering IT as a
                                                        Service to the business. It is an IT service
                                                        framework which is getting more popularity
                                                        due to the various benefits it provide over
                                                        the tradition IT infrastructure. Cloud
                                                        computing brings savings to the business due
                                                        to various factors such as virtualization,
                                                        consolidation, scalability, flexibility,
                                                        ease of manageability, automation, tenacity,
                                                        pay as per use etc. </p>

                                                    <p>Virtualization technology acted as the key
                                                        enabler for cloud computing platform by
                                                        introducing infrastructure flexibility i.e.
                                                        the costumers need not to own their personal
                                                        hardware to access the cloud services, easy
                                                        change management i.e. it is easy to change
                                                        the service provider and to get things
                                                        managed on the cloud platform, easy
                                                        administration at the client side as well as
                                                        the provider side as everything is automated
                                                        and low cost solution factor as one only has
                                                        to pay for the service and resources they
                                                        use (even few services are free of cost such
                                                        as the google drop box) etc. </p>

                                                    <p>Cloud can be classified on the basis of two
                                                        criteria: (1) the manner in which it is
                                                        deployed i.e. the cloud deployment models
                                                        and (2) the layer on which it operates i.e.
                                                        the cloud delivery models. There are 3 cloud
                                                        deployment models namely Private cloud,
                                                        Public cloud and Hybrid cloud. Also there
                                                        are 3 delivery models Infrastructure as a
                                                        Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
                                                        and Software as a Service (SaaS). </p>

                                                    <p>Switching from the traditional IT
                                                        infrastructure to the cloud computing
                                                        platform is also easy. The transformation
                                                        roadmap comprise of three easy steps: (1)
                                                        Consolidation and Virtualization which
                                                        involves moving from the pure physical
                                                        infrastructure to a virtual infrastructure
                                                        i.e. all the basic asset management,
                                                        monitoring and optimization is done in a
                                                        virtualized environment using virtualization
                                                        tools (2) Automation and Optimization which
                                                        includes recording the configuration of
                                                        various components in set up infrastructure
                                                        recorded in a centralized database and
                                                        enabling faster problem resolution (3)
                                                        Integration of Service Management which
                                                        involves setting up a Service Catalog for
                                                        the services available in the cloud which
                                                        may be used on-demand and on a self-service
                                                        basis.</p>

                                                    <p>As we all know that as soon as android comes
                                                        into market all the others operating systems
                                                        has to suffer a lot. But there is a reason
                                                        due to which this happens that is it is an
                                                        open source. Hence it is the best platform
                                                        for developers. So many new developers came
                                                        with their first app on this software and
                                                        this lead to junk on the play store. So in
                                                        this article we will go through the apps
                                                        that are best in each category of play
                                                        store. As play store divided it’s
                                                        applications in sub categories such as apps,
                                                        games. </p>

                                                    <p>First we will talk about apps in this there
                                                        are very genres so I take one of each.
                                                        Firstly we talk for musicians for them.
                                                        Caustic 3 is the best app for that you
                                                        should look for. It can be useful for those
                                                        who are making melodies while sitting one of
                                                        the best in its categories. Our next genre
                                                        explore us to new categories i.e. cloud
                                                        storage there are many apps for this type of
                                                        work but best is your Google drive. Next if
                                                        we move onto messaging apps then Facebook
                                                        messenger and what’s app are likely to be
                                                        the nominees but the award has been taken by
                                                        Drupe because of multi social nature and we
                                                        require it because we have accounts on
                                                        Facebook what’s app it is not much popular
                                                        but still best is best. Now if we move onto
                                                        lock screen apps we need customization in
                                                        these apps and for this next lock screen is
                                                        best. </p>

                                                    <p>Now we will enter in the world of games there
                                                        are various genre but I select some from all
                                                        and arrange them in serial order. First
                                                        marvel contest of champions from kabbom is
                                                        best of its kind with good graphics. Next is
                                                        from strategy games that are frozen synapse
                                                        and XCOM: the enemy within. The world ends
                                                        with you is a nice RPG and also having a
                                                        good response from the user. But in the last
                                                        the all-time favorite is our subway
                                                        surfer.</p>

                                                    <p>Four to five years earlier the grip of
                                                        telecom companies has been loosen over the
                                                        market but in the last two years a strong
                                                        comeback has recorded from these operators
                                                        as the usage of data services increases
                                                        tremendously. And now we can say that 2014
                                                        served as a new foundation growth year for
                                                        these operators. But the year 2015 will be
                                                        critical to this sector as it decide the
                                                        further future of this industry. So it is
                                                        not wrong to say that telecom industry have
                                                        a promising future in this year.</p>

                                                    <p>In India in 2015 the 3G spectrum bid is
                                                        awaited. And all the operators were eagerly
                                                        waiting for its outcomes and responses from
                                                        the people. But the deal doesn’t over here
                                                        only industry also hoping that all the
                                                        taxation issue will resolved as soon as
                                                        possible so that they can adjust their
                                                        charges accordingly and the profit margins
                                                        should be increased. But facts are much more
                                                        important than hopes and fact says that
                                                        there would be over 10 billion people will
                                                        be joined to these networks for data
                                                        services due to cheap smartphones and easily
                                                        available data packs . Further these
                                                        companies would be planning to implement 4g
                                                        as soon as possible as because this attracts
                                                        a large group of people who want speed and
                                                        better services at their mobiles. Again
                                                        these points show that the industry has a
                                                        promising future in India.</p>

                                                    <p>In my opinion telecom in India will faces
                                                        many challenges as it has been becoming
                                                        compulsory to revise the national telecom
                                                        policy. There is a trend to enhance the
                                                        basic telephony rate and that will add to
                                                        profitability which would be happen only if
                                                        the taxation matters will be resolved. There
                                                        will be investment to enhance the
                                                        infrastructure. We expect increase in
                                                        pricing for telecom offerings in the coming
                                                        year. But it is becoming necessary for them
                                                        to this stuff right now otherwise the whole
                                                        industry will have to suffer. But if we see
                                                        the overall condition that is very
                                                        satisfactory and does not have any danger on
                                                        its future further it have a strong base and
                                                        also a good future.</p>

                                                        into market. But what is 4g? And how it is
                                                        different from 3g and 2g? In this article we

                                                        from each other.</p>

                                                    <p>4G is basically stood for fourth generation

                                                        for 3G and 2G. As 4G is succeeding 3G
                                                        therefore it provides some more feature over
                                                        3G for example it provides mobile broadband
                                                        Internet access, for example to laptops with

                                                        mobile devices. Potential and current

                                                        services a network is considered as 4G but
                                                        there are some standards which have been set
                                                        by International Telecommunications
                                                        Union-Radio communications sector .
                                                        According to which the network should

                                                        meeting these requirements and hence these
                                                        two operators introduce the world with 4g
                                                        technology. These are the technological
                                                        basis of a 4G network spectrum. But to
                                                        understand the difference between these
                                                        generations we have to get back into
                                                        1980’s.</p>

                                                    <p>As the network systems were set up in 1980
                                                        and the spectrum was distributed for various
                                                        networking communities this generation is
                                                        termed as the 1st generation and from then
                                                        as research is improving the speed and
